# Footprinting

Footprinting is the process of gathering information about a target organisation, system, or network prior to an attack or security assessment. It is typically the first phase of the attack lifecycle and focuses on collecting sensitive information with minimal or no interaction with the target.

The information gathered during footprinting helps an attacker understand the target’s environment and identify potential attack vectors.

## Types of Footprinting

### Passive Footprinting
Passive footprinting involves gathering information without directly interacting with the target systems. This reduces the likelihood of detection.

Examples include:
- Search engine queries
- Publicly available documents
- Social media analysis
- Data leaks and breach repositories

---

### Active Footprinting
Active footprinting involves direct interaction with the target systems and infrastructure.

Examples include:
- DNS queries
- Website inspection and mirroring
- Network queries and probes

While active footprinting yields richer data, it increases the risk of detection.

## Information Collected

Footprinting commonly reveals:

- **Organisational Information**  
  Employee roles, contact details, and operational structure

- **Network Information**  
  Domains, IP ranges, DNS records, and network topology

- **System Information**  
  Operating systems, web servers, services, usernames, and configuration details

## Threats Introduced by Footprinting

- Social engineering attacks
- Network and system intrusion
- Information leakage
- Privacy compromise
- Corporate espionage
- Financial and reputational loss

---

## Defensive Considerations

- Minimise publicly exposed information
- Harden DNS and web services
- Apply information disclosure controls
- Educate staff on social engineering risks
