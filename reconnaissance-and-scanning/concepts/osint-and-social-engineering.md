# OSINT and Social Engineering

Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) refers to the collection of information from publicly available sources. Attackers frequently combine OSINT with social engineering to gain unauthorized access to systems or sensitive data.

## OSINT Sources

Common OSINT sources include:
- Search engines
- Social networking platforms
- Public breach databases
- Public records and forums

Information collected can include usernames, email addresses, employment details, and technology usage.

## Social Engineering

Social engineering is the manipulation of individuals into revealing confidential information by exploiting trust, authority, or urgency.

Common attack types:
- Phishing
- Pretexting
- Impersonation
- Baiting

OSINT often provides the contextual detail required to make social engineering attacks highly convincing.

## Security Implications

- Human behavior is often the weakest security link
- OSINT increases attack realism and success rates
- Technical controls alone are insufficient without user awareness

## Defensive Measures

- Security awareness training
- Verification procedures
- Limiting public exposure of employee details
